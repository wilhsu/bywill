				<p>For this project, we were asked to choose a poem or story and to recreate the main ideas only using images through HTML and CSS. Immediately after this project was introduced, I thought of the poem <i>Because I Could Not Stop for Death</i> by Emily Dickinson. The poem was spoken from Dickinson’s perspective and takes the audience on a journey with her personified perception of death. We were also not allowed to use any images from the internet, so I decided to use this as an opportunity to use my own images and videos and create a similar effect of experiencing the sceneries of death
				<br><br>
				I initially made three storyboard sketches that illustrate the scenes and main concepts of the poem. I also tried to plan out the different segments and how it would visually appeal to the viewer/user of the website.

				<br><br>
				The main concept of this project was that Dickinson would be following the user as they scroll through each grayscale image as they both experience the events in her poem. Initially I was just experimenting with different positioning properties and I found the “sticky” property, which really helped enhance my concept for this project. The Dickinson illustration was also initially in the dead center of the page, but I thought that it would be much more interesting and coherent if she was on the side and the viewer became the main focus that experiences the sceneries.

				Through this project, I realized the importance of serendipity in coding. Although mistakes in coding are usually detrimental and annoying in regards to one’s vision of their website, it can sometimes be helpful and a surprisingly interesting mistake that they decide to implement in their final websites. I also think that because coding is so rigid, that making mistakes and discovering more features about it is an essential element in learning how to code.
