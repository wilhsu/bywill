				<p>For this project, we had to create a loop with at least ten different websites that eventually lead the users back to the starting page. As soon as I heard the requirements for this project I had a lot of ideas that I wanted to implement for this project. The three main ideas I originally had were: a carnival, a tunnel of love, or something about a book. I really wanted to create a carnival-like experience for the users and have them explore through each page of the websites as if they were going on these rides themselves.
				<br><br>
				I ended up going with the concept of <i>Inferno</i>, a book written by Dante that depicts his journey through the nine circles of hell, which is perfect for the 10+ website requirement. I also decided that this experience should also be fun and cute and very sarcastically engaging for the viewers, so that it’s not dead serious and scary in any way. Throughout the website, there is a tour guide, Virgil, who also guided Dante throughout his book. I made him into this cute, appealing character that would charm the viewers. My initial sketches show the individual websites that the users would go through in a coherent order, and the general planning of the loops.

				For each circle, I assigned them color palettes and title fonts that would correspond to the general theme of each specific circle of hell. In addition, for some circles, I also added interesting CSS animation effects to further enhance the experience for the audience and encapsulate the energy of the circle. The exemplar sketches that I did for each circle were also the attempts to figure out how the user would view the websites individually.

				Throughout this project, I learned the importance of having a coherent system and planning beforehand, especially for websites that have multiple external links like this one. Originally, I was just going to wing this website and create the websites individually, but I realized that wasn’t going to work. This lead me to creating a planning document and writing out the general plans I had for each website, and taking notes on how they would be similar or different to each other so that I don’t mess things up while trying to work as efficiently.
