					For this project, we had to introduce ourselves and familiarize ourselves with properties of HTML, including using lists and divs and headings and paragraphs, etc. At the end of the page, we also had to include ten facts about us, and get as creative as we can with the HTML styling properties.
					<br><br>
					With this website, we learn a lot about the basic properties of HTML, and also explore a lot of the features that it has. I tried to create a lot of different effects with the information I’ve gained regarding HTML, including playing around with scales and different colors, as well as adding images and changing the fonts in several parts of the website.
					<br><br>
					From this project, I learned that it’s important to be grounded while still being creative. Although there were multiple interesting ideas that I had and wanted to implement, it was impossible to implement all of them, especially with what I’ve learned, so it’s also really important to realize the limitations of certain media. It’s also really important to structure websites and have a really strong basis rather than having really complicated yet disorganized elements in a website.
