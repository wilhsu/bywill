			<h1>LIMBO</h1>

			<p>Welcome to the first circle of hell! This circle of hell is also known as Limbo, and is occupied by the unbaptized and virtuous pagans. It’s kind of like the retirement community of afterlife!</p>

			<p>It’s mostly resided by virtuous non-Christians and unbaptized pagans who are punished with eternity in an inferior form of Heaven.</p>

			<p>Oooh y'all are lucky today!! Look over there and you can see Aristotle… That one there is Hippocrates!.... And that’s Julius Caesar!!....</p>
