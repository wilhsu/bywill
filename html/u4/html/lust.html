		<p>Oh… Hi Minos!! Everyone… say hi to Minos! He’s the monster that lurks on the border of the second circle, who basically assigns the condemned souls to their punishments!</p>

		<img id="minos" src="../assets/img/minos.png">

		<p>If you look closely, the amount of times he wraps his tail around himself indicates the number of circle the soul must go… pretty cool huh?</p>

		<p>Anyways… welcome to the second circle,</p>

		<h1>LUST</h1>
		<div>
		<p>Hope everyone brought a little raincoat!! Haha…. The souls of the Lustful swirl about in a terrible… TERRIBLE storm. They are punished by being blown violently back and forth by strong winds, preventing them from finding peace and rest…. Kinda funny to me haha…</p>

		<p>Being the good tour guide I am, I’ll explain the intentions of the strong winds. The strong winds symbolize the restlessness of a person who is led by the desire for fleshly pleasures. So… if any of ya’ll fear the storm… remember not to commit adultery! Haha!!</p>

		<p>Ooh you guys sure are lucky today! There you can see Francesca, Cleopatra, and Helen of Troy…. Everyone say hi!! </p>

		<p>Okay okay… that’s enough…. Before they seduce y’all, let’s enter the next circle <a href="gluttony.html">this way!</a></p>
