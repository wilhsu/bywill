		<h1>GLUTTONY</h1>

		<p>Welcome to the third circle everyone!</p>

		<img id="cerberus" src="../assets/img/cerberus.png">

		<p>You can see that this circle of hell is guarded by a worm-monster, its name is Cerberus! It’s okay.. You can pet it…. It don’t bite….. Unless you’re a glutton haha….</p>

		<p>So… as you can see, sinners in this circle are punished by being forced to lie in a vile slush that is produced by never-ending icy rain</p>

		<p>The vile slush symbolizes personal degradation of one who overindulges in food, drink, and other worldly pleasures, while the inability to see others lying nearby represents the gluttons’ selfishness and coldness</p>
