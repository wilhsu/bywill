				<p>For this project, we had to create a type specimen website for a chosen typeface we found online. I decided to go with a typeface called PassionOne by FontStage. Since there wasn't much background information or interesting explorations regarding this typeface, I decided to make my specimen an exaggerated understanding of the word “passion.” The texts I found for the specimen were texts from the wikipedia page for “passion,” and I also decided to implement vibrant warm colors in the website to exemplify a passionate feeling. Since there also weren't many weight differences in the families, I also decided to highlight them throughout the website.
				<br><br>
				Another interesting element that I included in my website was this heart collecting feature that allowed the viewer to scroll through the website and collect these png hearts that I made through with Illustrator. With this project, I really wanted to make this website as vibrant and warm as possible, and I really wanted to make the typeface stand out and seem really bold. I also wanted to make the glyph section really well structured and clean so I spent quite some time making it and repositioning the glyphs.

				Initially, I made three sketches for this website, and I sort of combined all three of them for the final one. I think it’s obvious that I decided to use the final sketch as the main concept and implemented that into my final website. As a final touch, I created a visual representation, sort of like a storyboard of how the website would look like in the final page.

				From this project, I learned a lot about flexboxes and how they function. Before this project, I didn’t really have a great understanding about how flexboxes work because I’ve only used them once for a website, but this project really forced me to look into it which became really helpful. In addition, I also had a better understanding of the positioning functions and how they would interact with the website as a whole.
